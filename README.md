## 📝Description

We propose to create an immersive and enlightening online platform dedicated to the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most revered spiritual texts in the world.

Our website will not only present the sacred text but also offer a variety of multimedia content, stories, and animations that elucidate its profound messages. Furthermore, we will introduce a unique feature that tailors content to users' moods, making the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita relevant to their daily lives.

   - Like-minded individuals are grouped together to foster meaningful discussions on a range of topics.

5. **Basic Settings**
   - Seamless signup/login via email or phone number.
